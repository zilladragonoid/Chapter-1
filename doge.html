                Doge (usually /doʊdʒ/ DOHJ, /doʊɡ/ DOHG or /doʊʒ/ DOHZH) is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme
                consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog, accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The
                text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English. The meme
                originally and most frequently uses an image of a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, though versions with other Shiba Inus are also
                popular.
                
                The meme is based on a 2010 photograph of Kabosu which became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top
                meme" of that year. The Shiba Inu had a notable presence in popular culture in late 2013, including a cryptocurrency
                based on Doge, the Dogecoin, launching in December of that year. Several online polls and media outlets recognized Doge
                as one of the best Internet memes of the 2010s.
